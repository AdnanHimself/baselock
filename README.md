## How It Works

### 1. Create a Lock 🛠️
Have a file on Dropbox, a Google Doc, or a secret link you want to sell?
1.  **Connect your Wallet** (we support MetaMask, Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet, and more).
2.  **Paste your Link**: This is the secret content users will pay to see.
3.  **Set a Price**: Choose how much ETH you want to charge.
4.  **Click Create**: We generate a unique, secure link for you.

### 2. Share & Earn 💸
Copy your unique **BaseLock Link** and share it anywhere:
-   Twitter / X
-   Discord Communities
-   Telegram Groups
-   Email Newsletters

### 3. Users Pay to Unlock 🔓
When someone clicks your link:
1.  They see your public title and price.
2.  They click **"Pay to Unlock"**.
3.  The ETH is sent **directly to your wallet** via the Base blockchain.
4.  Once the payment is verified, the secret link is instantly revealed to them.
